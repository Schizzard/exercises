# Lightbulb End Watching

# In the third mission from the series about lightbulbs, I want to separately
# highlight the process and the period of observation of this process.

# In the previous mission, the start_watching parameter was introduced, and in
# this one - the end_watching parameter, which tells the time when itâ€™s
# necessary to end the observation. If itâ€™s not passed, the mission works as in
# the previous version, with no observation time limit.

# One more update is that the amount of elements (button clicks) can be odd
# (previously there was a precondition, that the amount of elements is always
# even).

# Input: Three arguments and only the first one is required. The first one is a
# list of datetime objects, the second and the third ones are the datetime
# objects.
# Output: A number of seconds as an integer.

# Example:
# sum_light([
#     datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 0, 0),
#     datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 10, 10),
#     datetime(2015, 1, 12, 11, 0, 0),
# ],
# datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 10, 0),
# datetime(2015, 1, 12, 11, 0, 10)) == 20

# sum_light([
#     datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 0, 0),
# ],
# datetime(2015, 1, 12, 9, 9, 0),
# datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 0, 0)) == 0

# sum_light([
#     datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 0, 0),
#     datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 10, 10),
#     datetime(2015, 1, 12, 11, 0, 0),
#     datetime(2015, 1, 12, 11, 10, 10),
# ],
# datetime(2015, 1, 12, 9, 0, 0),
# datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 5, 0)) == 300

# Precondition:
# The array of pressing the button is always sorted in ascending order.
# The array of pressing the button has no repeated elements.
# The minimum possible date is 1970-01-01
# The maximum possible date is 9999-12-31
