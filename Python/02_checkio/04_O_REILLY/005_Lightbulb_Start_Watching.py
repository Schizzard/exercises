# Lightbulb Start Watching

# This is the second mission in the lightbulb series. I will try to make each
# following task slightly more complex.

# You have already learned how to count the amount of time a light bulb has
# been on, or how long a room has been lit. Now let's add one more parameter -
# the counting start time.

# This means that the light continues to turn on and off as before. But now, as
# a result of the function, I want not only to know how long there was light in
# the room, but how long the room was lit, starting from a certain moment.

# One more argument is added – start_watching , and if it’s not passed, we
# count as in the previous version of the program for the entire period.

# Input: Two arguments and only the first one is required. The first one is a
# list of datetime objects and the second one is a datetime object.
# Output: A number of seconds as an integer.

# Example:

# sum_light([
#     datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 0, 0),
#     datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 0, 10),
# ],
# datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 0, 5)) == 5

# sum_light([
#     datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 0, 0),
#     datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 0, 10),
# ], datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 0, 0)) == 10

# sum_light([
#     datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 0, 0),
#     datetime(2015, 1, 12, 10, 10, 10),
#     datetime(2015, 1, 12, 11, 0, 0),
#     datetime(2015, 1, 12, 11, 10, 10),
# ], datetime(2015, 1, 12, 11, 0, 0)) == 610

# Precondition:

# The array of pressing the button is always sorted in ascending order
# The array of pressing the button has no repeated elements
# The amount of elements is always even (the light will eventually be off)
# The minimum possible date is 1970-01-01
# The maximum possible date is 9999-12-31
